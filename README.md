# C++ code
This repository is mainly used to share codes of my C++ coursework, which are compiled in DevC++.
If there is any mistake or disadvantages, please help me correct it and make it more effective.
Also, welcome to exchange or share your understandings and perceptions of the projects or even C++ here.
